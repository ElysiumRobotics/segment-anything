Segment Anything 


Installation

Following: https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything

In lightning

sudo apt install libopencv-dev
sudo apt install libxcb-cursor0

## Installed CUDA
Following nvidia instructions I installed and verified cuda-12.1

I had to go back and install cuDNN. I could not verify it directly. 

## Setup Environment and Install PyTorch
mkdir ~/Documents/Projects/microFibers/segment_anything
conda create -n segment_anything python=3.10; conda activate segment_anything
# conda create -n segment_anything python=3.10 opencv matplotlib; conda activate segment_anything # This later triggers a 'solving env fail'


Using PyTorch Configurator at: https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/

pip3 install torch torchvision torchaudio --index-url https://download.pytorch.org/whl/cu118 # This worked!!!

`conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio pytorch-cuda=11.8 -c pytorch -c nvidia` # Did not work.
- A post () said 11.8 works with cuda 12.1
  - https://discuss.pytorch.org/t/install-pytorch-with-cuda-12-1/174294/3
  
Compile it from source: Did not work 

### Testing PyTorch
- Launch `python`
import torch
x = torch.rand(5, 3)
print(x)
torch.cuda.is_available()
torch.backends.cudnn.enabled
torch.backends.cudnn.version()
- Should return True, True, 8700

## Back to Segment Anything

cd segment-anything; pip install -e .
#conda install opencv matplotlib;

## Test it
python scripts/amg.py --checkpoint model/sam_vit_h_4b8939.pth --model-type vit_h --input /home/Projects/uFibers/Elysium_Micrographs/2023/spools/spool_224/20230426/bundleset_50_1/1/cross-section/230427_1246_000_G001_I.jpg --output output/
    God damn it!
    torch.cuda.OutOfMemoryError: CUDA out of memory. Tried to allocate 15.35 GiB (GPU 0; 7.78 GiB total capacity; 3.28 GiB already allocated; 3.75 GiB free; 3.61 GiB reserved in total by PyTorch) If reserved memory is >> allocated memory try setting max_split_size_mb to avoid fragmentation.  See documentation for Memory Management and PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF

Instead, running the example at https://github.com/facebookresearch/segment-anything/blob/main/notebooks/automatic_mask_generator_example.ipynb
- coding it into testing.py 



I started to run into issues. 
- Some QT GUI stuff.
- Python/VSC would kill the process
- Then moved to running from script... Torche not compiled with CUDA. 

These fucking things are always so fragile. 
- On a next attempt, start by upgrading CUDA. 



conda deactivate; conda remove --name segment_anything --all
